# AppDynamics Ansible Collection

The AppDynamics Ansible Collection installs and configures AppDynamics agents. All supported agents are downloaded from the download portal unto the Ansible control node automatically –– this makes it easy to acquire and upgrade agents declaratively.

Additionally, this AppDynamics Ansible Collection supports auto-instrumenation of JBoss(Wildfly) and Tomcat, on Linux only. 

Refer to the [role variables](#Role-Variables) below for a description of available deployment options.

We built this AppDynamics Ansible collection to support (immutable) infrastructure as code deployment methodology; this means that the collection will NOT preserve any manual configuration changes on the target servers. In other words, the collection will overwrite any local or pre-existing configuration with the variables that are defined in the playbook.  Therefore, we strongly recommend that you convert any custom agent configuration (this collection does not support) into an ansible role to ensure consistency of deployments and configurations across your estate.
